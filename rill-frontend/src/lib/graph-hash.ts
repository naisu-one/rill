 * Pure helpers for turning a compiled flow graph into a short, stable content
 * hash — used to key publish-result idempotence in export-dialog.tsx (R16):
 * same graph content -> same cached skill URL; a changed graph -> presented
 * as unpublished, requiring a new explicit Publish click.
 *
 * No crypto dependency: this only needs to reliably detect "did the graph
 * change," not resist tampering, so a small dependency-free non-cryptographic
 * hash is enough — and keeps this synchronous (crypto.subtle.digest is async
 * and would force every caller into an effect just to compute a cache key).
 * Pure and exported for direct unit testing (U12).
